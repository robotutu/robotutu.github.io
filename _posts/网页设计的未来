When I was designing magazines,
no one ever talked about click rates,
or conversion funnels or usability patterns.
 We simply had to trust that our readers knew how to open the magazine,
  how to find the contents page and how to read page numbers.
  And most people did. I think. (We had no accurate way of checking.)
